#__Monitoring Solutions Test__

##Info
Built using ReactJS, Redux, Typescript with Recharts and SASS

##Decisions
1. I pulled in the data from the API into redux so I can resuse on different pages and it was to be stored in one place
2. I Used a generic page for routing to show how you can use same component and split it up depending on the url. I could have used a new page for each url. 
3. With no scope, the design is quite generic.
4. There is a lot more I could do with the data but as it should be simple app I have tried keep data logic as minimum for what I wanted to display.
5. I could have created more components lower down, but due to timeframe I kept it clean but not completely refactored.
6. I have refrained from using a template so I could customise it from scratch for styles.

##Additions
1. With more time, I would add sorting/filtering to the data. Especially for the movies, where you can sort by the views for each provider. I could show a list of movies (cards) with all relevant Meta data.
2. Once full designed, it would be much easier to create the site based on the guidelines. Having logos, colours, fonts, icons implemented into the site.
3. I would add more images, icons in to make it look better and range of colours to improve the look
4. I would have a fully compatable mobile site - as not enough time I haven't included the graphs for small screens.
5. It would be more responsive to all screen sizes and fully tested.
6. It would have a lot more data to show on dashboard and interesting stats.
7. I would add further animations and tranistions to the site.
8. Mainly the dashboard component would be refactored and put into smaller functional components.
